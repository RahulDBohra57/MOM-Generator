# AI-Powered Modular Minutes of Meeting (MoM) Generator

**AI-Powered Modular MoM Generator** is an intelligent document automation system that converts unstructured meeting notes — including handwritten images, scanned PDFs, and text files — into standardized, structured, and downloadable Minutes of Meeting (MoM) within minutes.

## Executive Summary

In industries such as construction, infrastructure, civil engineering, and project management, meeting documentation remains heavily manual and inconsistent.

Teams often rely on:
- Handwritten notebooks  
- WhatsApp images  
- Scanned PDFs  
- Informal text notes  

These fragmented formats make it difficult to:
- Track accountability  
- Assign ownership  
- Monitor deadlines  
- Maintain auditable documentation  

The **AI-Powered Modular MoM Generator** solves this problem by using **Vision AI + Generative AI** to automatically extract, structure, and standardize meeting minutes across multiple input formats.

## Problem Statement

Despite widespread adoption of ERP and collaboration tools, organizations still face major challenges:

-  Fragmented documentation across formats  
-  Missing task ownership and deadlines  
-  Delayed follow-ups due to unclear action items  
-  Manual MoM preparation taking 45–60 minutes  
-  Lack of standard structure across teams  

This gap between raw discussions and execution leads to:
- Project delays  
- Coordination failures  
- Compliance risks  
- Rework costs
